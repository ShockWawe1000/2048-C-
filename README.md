Simple C++ 2048 Game
This project is a simple implementation of the popular 2048 game using C++. It provides a console-based interface for playing the game and aims to recreate the addictive and challenging gameplay of the original.

Features
Game Logic: The Simple C++ 2048 Game faithfully implements the core mechanics of the 2048 game. It allows players to move tiles on a grid, combine matching numbers, and strive to reach the elusive 2048 tile.

Console Interface: The game features a simple yet intuitive console-based interface. Players can input commands to move tiles in four directions: up, down, left, and right. The game board and current score are displayed on the console.

Random Tile Generation: New tiles with values of 2 or 4 are randomly generated on the game board after each move. This ensures unpredictability and presents players with new challenges as they try to merge tiles strategically.

Score Tracking: The game keeps track of the player's score, reflecting the total value of merged tiles. Players can compete against themselves or others to achieve the highest score possible.

How to Play
To play the Simple C++ 2048 Game, follow these steps:

Clone or download the project from the GitHub repository.

Open the project in a C++ development environment, such as Visual Studio or Code::Blocks.

Build and compile the source code.

Run the compiled executable.

The game will display the initial game board and prompt for input.

Use the arrow keys or designated commands (e.g., 'W', 'S', 'A', 'D') to move the tiles on the board in the corresponding direction.

After each move, new tiles will appear, and the game will update the board and score.

Continue making moves and combining tiles until you reach the 2048 tile or are unable to make any more valid moves.

The game will display a message indicating whether you won or lost.
